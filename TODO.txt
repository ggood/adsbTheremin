Get nearest.py running with no more LED code

Abstract out the code that reads input data so it can read a dump
of data and play it back at various speeds (does it have
timestamp data? It needs to). If not just assume equal time
between messages. Then be able to scale up/down the time.
Idea is to be able to update the data structure of known
aircraft muchg more frequently but the MIDI note update still
runs at a slower speed like once per second. Although maybe
make the update dependent on environmental factors like number of
planes, time of day, etc.
